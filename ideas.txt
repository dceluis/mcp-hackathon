why?

tasker is an automation tool for Android. It allows you to call phone actions
like get contacts, interact with the screen, read screen contents and so on.

It is very powerful as in it allow you to basically create applications without
having to write an apk for it.

The problem is that creating 'tasks' in tasker is time consuming because its
done through a phone ui. And 'programming' the task as code is not a easy fit
eitebr because it uses a custom xml format that is very hard to work with.

So, my idea is to create a big tasker project that provides atomic tasks for
most of the existing tasker actions and provide an mcp server so that llms can
create applications on the fly with just the action definitions. without needing
to manually create tasks using the tasker ui.

I a sense, tasker is an api for android automation

Writing an application for phone automation in:

lang,                 power,          simplicity
Kotlin or Java,       highest,        lowest
tasker,               high,           medium *
tasker mcp,           medium**,       easy***

*graphical ui is time consuming
** it will never be possible to implement the full feature set of tasker on the mcp server (unless we provide some meta action that can create actions in tasker??, out of scope in this hackathon version)
*** text based instructions. even better, voice instructions***

I think that if implemented correctly it will be a sort of open source google
assistant. And even better, because google assistant has only a small number of
things it can outomate (mostly google services), whereas with tasker, your
imagination is the limit
